!!! tip "What is a workspace?"
    A workspace is a place where all your Fief data lives: configuration, users data, etc.

    Each workspace has its own subdomain reserved for you, like [https://example.fief.dev](https://example.fief.dev).

    If you are working on several projects or companies, we recommend to create several workspaces to keep things organized.
