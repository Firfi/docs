# What is Fief?

Fief is an **open-source platform** to manage **users** and **authentication** in your applications. Our goal is to help you manage users and security in a matter of minutes, not days. Key features:

* Pre-built login and registration pages
* Users management dashboard
* SDK for the most popular languages and frameworks
* Integrations for the most popular no-code tools
* Bring Your Own Database : you can connect to any SQL database so you keep entire control of your data

## Cloud vs Self-hosted

We are offering two ways of using Fief:

1. [Cloud](https://www.fief.dev): fair-priced hosted instance, maintained by the Fief's team;
2. Self-hosted: you host the service yourself on your own infrastructure, for free.
