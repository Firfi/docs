## Base URL

Each tenant is tied to a **base URL**: each routes, like login or registration, will be derived from this base. When you integrate Fief in your application, you'll need this base URL.

Each workspace has **one default tenant** with a base URL pointing to your root subdomain, like *https://example.fief.dev*.

Other tenants gets a path prefix, like *https://example.fief.dev/other-tenant*.

!!! tip
    You can copy the base URL directly using the clipboard button in the list.

!!! bug "Limitation"
    At the moment, new tenants can't be created from the admin dashboard.
