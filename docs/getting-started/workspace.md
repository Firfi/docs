# Create your workspace

The easiest way to get started is to create your workspace on our [official Fief instance](https://www.fief.dev). After having created your user account, you'll be guided through the creation of your **workspace**.

## Step 1: name your workspace

The first step is to name your workspace. Use a name describing your application or company: it'll be used to generate your workspace subdomain.

For example, a workspace named *Bretagne Duchy* will be assigned to the subdomain *https://bretagne-duchy.fief.dev*.

## Step 2: select your type of database

One of the great strength of Fief is that you can **bring your own database** to store your workspace data. This way, you keep in total control of your data. Of course, we also propose you to store your data on our performand and secure cloud database. Your choice!

At this step, you can make the choice between the Fief cloud database or configure your own.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll choose here the **cloud database**. If you want to bring your own database, we recommend you to read the [dedicated section](../going-further/byod.md).

## Ready to go!

That's it! At this point, everything is ready to create your workspace!

After that, you'll be redirected to your admin dashboard, where you'll be able to manage your workspace.
